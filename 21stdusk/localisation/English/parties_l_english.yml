Most Socialist ideologies follow the heritage and theories of the German Philosophers Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels, but others follow different ideologies, from Proudhon to Eugene Debs. What unifies Socialism is a distrust for Tyranny and the rich, and a wish to create a new system to replace the current one with.

For more than a century, Technocratic ideals remained amongst a small fringe, at times presumably less than a few thousand believers worldwide - that was until the Climate Crisis and the worldwide retreat of Democracy. At first it was only a trickle, a reborn fetal kick. Small networks of clubs forming in stagnant or affected Nations. But then Willow Tiyana Samantha Dermont (Often called W.T.S Dermont) wrote the treatise “A Manifesto on the Future of Humanity as a Technocracy”. Despite seeing herself as a simple Technocratist, Dermont became the foundation of a New School of thought called Dermontism, Dermont becoming as influential to Technocracy as Marx was to Socialism. Technocracy as an ideology group believes that in some way, the Government should be made up primarily by Experts, whilst Dermontism combines this with a remnant of Representative Democracy, a dualistic system where, rather than A True Bicameral Legislature, the Legislature is made up of two distinct groups: A Conclave of Experts in every field, and a weaker, but not exactly powerless or even weak, Unicameral Legislature. Dermontism is the Main current in Modern Technocratic Thought, but whether Willow’s predictions will come true is a matter only time will tell…. §Y The Earth, even in her hurt state, is bountiful enough to provide all Mankind needs without throwing out our Socio-Economic system or resorting to Red Tyranny.

That's what was thought.. until during the early 21st century, Neo-Nazism was born. As Xenophobic, Genocidal, racialist and Totalitarian as original Nazism, it vies for a unified fascist state, with the race having a homeland where all members outside of the race are exterminated from.§"
